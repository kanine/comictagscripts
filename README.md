# comictagscripts

A collection of scripts I use to make managing a comic collection a little easier.

**update_volume_if_different_folder_all.py**

Example:
python update_volume_if_different_folder_all.py

You will then be prompted for a folder, all subfolders will then be processed checking if the ComicInfo.xml file has a volume that matches the year in the parent folder (in parenthesis).

So My Comic (2013) folder would have all .cbz files set to Volume 2013.
